Windows:
    - Running elevated command in java:
    Runtime.getRuntime().exec("runas /profile /user:Administrator \"cmd.exe /c Powrprof.dll,SetSuspendState\"");

    - Poweshell:
        - Update help/ manual pages:
            Update-Help
        - get all commands:
            Get-Command -Type All
    * Choco:
        - get related installed package/application cli commands, and parse into a list:
        ```
           Get-Command -Type All | Out-File -FilePath .\Commands.txt
           Select-String -Path .\Commands.txt -Pattern "<package-name>"
       ```
       Can also try below:
       1. List Existing Files Before Installation
       ```
           $beforeBin = Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name
       ```
       2. Install the Package
       ```
           choco install <package-name> -y
       ```
       3. List New Files After Installation
       ```
           $afterBin = Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name
       ```
       4. Find the Difference
       ```
           $newBinFiles = Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $beforeBin -DifferenceObject $afterBin | Select-Object -ExpandProperty InputObject
           $newBinFiles
       ```
       If any new executables appear, they are likely the CLI commands exposed by the package.
Linux:
    - Get all the commands that can be run by the shell, even after installation of a new program:
    print -rC1 -- ${(ko)commands}
    - For advanced functionalities, check if the command trying to be run after a certain package is installed
    is in the list of below commands:
    ```
        dpkg -L <package-name> | grep -E "/bin/|/sbin/|/usr/bin/|/usr/sbin/"
        # OR
        rpm -ql <package-name> | grep -E "/bin/|/sbin/|/usr/bin/|/usr/sbin/"
    ```
    Another alternative would be:
    ```
        man -k <package-name>
    ```
